During my third year of university, I collaborated with three colleagues to develop a Smart Mirror project. The project was built using MagicMirror² software, designed specifically to run on a Raspberry Pi, which served as the core controller of the system.

The Smart Mirror featured a variety of modules, including:

Weather display

Calendar with reminders

Custom messages

Spotify integration, allowing users to listen to music while getting ready

Unfortunately, the original source code was stored on a teammate’s laptop and is no longer available. As a result, I’ve included comprehensive documentation instead, featuring:

A detailed step-by-step explanation of how we built the project

Photos of the actual Smart Mirror

Insights into its features and functionality

This documentation provides a clear overview of the project and the process behind its creation.
